# üéôÔ∏è Voice Chat with Your PDFs (Yes, Really!)

Welcome to the **Voice Chat with PDFs** project! Imagine talking to your PDFs and getting answers like a real conversation, powered by the magical combo of [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It's like turning your PDFs into your personal assistants!

## What‚Äôs Going On Here?

This project takes inspiration from the super cool [openai-realtime-console](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-console), but we‚Äôve spiced it up by adding a simple RAG system (fancy talk for making your chats smarter) using [LlamaIndexTS](https://ts.llamaindex.ai/).

## Prerequisites

- **An OpenAI API Key** ‚Äì This is the magic wand that powers the whole thing. You can get one (user key or project key) and pop it into the `.env` file or set it as an environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY`). Trust me, it won‚Äôt work without it!

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install the Stuff
Run this magical line to get all the things you need:
